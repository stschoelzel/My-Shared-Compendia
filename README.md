- `Spells (shared)` ([Item](https://foundryvtt.com/article/items/))
- `Subclasses (shared)` ([Item](https://foundryvtt.com/article/items/))

## Customize

To change the default setup, edit the `module.json` file. All compendia are defined within the "packs" attribute beginning with line 18.

For example:

```json
{
  "packs": [
    {
      "name": "monsters",
      "system": "dnd5e",
      "label": "Monsters",
      "path": "./packs/monsters.db",
      "module": "my-shared-compendia",
      "type": "Actor"
    },
    {
      "name": "my-custom-items",
      "system": "dnd5e",
      "label": "My Custom Items",
      "path": "./packs/items.db",
      "module": "my-shared-compendia",
      "type": "Item"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: There are no compendium Types for Classes, Feats, and Features in Foundry, so the `Item` type is generally used for these.

## Dependencies

- [DnD5e Game System](https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e) is required: The Game System adds some SRD Compendia.
- Using [Compendium Folders](https://github.com/earlSt1/vtt-compendium-folders) is highly recommended.
